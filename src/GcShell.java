/**
 * @Author: Dennis Parkman and Jake Morris
 * Date: 2/02/21
 * Purpose: To create a custom shell that can run custom commands using API calls to other utilities.
 *
 * How to Use:
 * First, compile the program using:
 * javac GcShell.java
 * java GcShell
 *
 * Then, type in the regular commands as you would in bash or nano.
 * Additional specialty commands include:
 *
 * history - command that allows the user to see a log of their previous commands.
 * example: gcshell> history
 *
 * !! - command that allows the user to see and repeat their perviously used command.
 * example: gcshell> !!
 *
 * quit - command that allows the user to end their use of gcshell and return to normal shell program.
 * example: gcshell> quit
 *
 * Academic Honesty Statement:
 *
 * We are the authors of this project, however we did use the following resources for our project:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-getcanonicalpath-method-in-java-with-examples/
 * https://www.developer.com/java/data/understanding-java-process-and-java-processbuilder.html
 *
 *
 * I discussed this problem with:
 * Nobody
